<!--
  Test I received recently for an interview. Hiding some specifics so their interview isn't public. It's basic but made sense for this particular side thing I may do. Far from the best or efficient but getting the gears turning again to shake the rust off. Haven't been coding as actively as a manager the past 6 years. Solution file contains a simple solution and the one I submitted which is more complex. You can open the file directly in the browser as you code to test.

  Assignment

  There is one HTML file that containing 2 <p> tags and some JS. You need to access your car collection and display it on the page.
    1) Our data has a bug and not currently available to use for the next requirements. Fix and make it available to log.
    2) The data contains something similar to JSON but is returned as a string. Improve the data model (minimum) to separate the car models and their manufacturing into 2 arrays.
    3) Each rendered string to the page needs the first letter capitalized.
    4) Each manufacturer and their corresponding model should be injected into their respective <p> tags.
    5) Leave comments on code that may not be clear or is worth explaining your reasoning for it.

  The requirements are the baseline but there is ample opportunities to expand on your solution or point to how our actual system could be improved.
